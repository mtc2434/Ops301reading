# How to capture network traffic ? SPAN vs TAP Notes
## What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?
- SPAN: Switched Port Analyzer is a feature provided by network switches. It allows the mirroring of network traffic from one or more source ports to a destination port.
- TAP: Test Access Port is a hardware device that connects between network devices. TAPs passively copy network traffic from the source to the destination, allowing comprehensive visibility into network traffic.
## What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?
- Switches, routers, and firewalls. 
## How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?
- By capturing network traffic, security devices like intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and network analyzers can inspect the traffic for potential threats and anomalies. 
## Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?
- Privacy, Consent, Compliance
