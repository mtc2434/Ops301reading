# CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes

## What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
- It is the notation that follows a specific outline for a network range. There is a slash at the end and a number that indicates how many IP Addresses are available on the network

## How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
There are four octets, creating a 32 bit address.

## Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
- technically 255, but I believe 0 and 1 are reserved, so It's more like 254

## What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
- The final digit after the "/" represents the amount of IP addresses that can be made on that network

## How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
- 256 IP addresses. This is where the point I brought up earlier comes. This is where the 2 addresses are reserved, so it's more like 254
