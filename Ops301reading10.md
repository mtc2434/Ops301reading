# What is a virtual private cloud (VPC)?(Notes)
- A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. VPC customers can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but the private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider.
## How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?
- There is a private cloud within the public cloud. A VPC isolates computing resources from the other computing resources available in the public cloud.
## What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part?
- Web Servers, APIs, Load balancers.
## What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?
Scalability and security can be pretty good. I think the cost would be decent, but it might take longer to learn how to configure, and with VPC you are tied with a specific vendor
