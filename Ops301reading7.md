# What Is NGINX? Notes

## What are some common use cases for NGINX?
- "As a software‑only all-in-one load balancer, web server, API gateway, and reverse proxy that is designed for cloud‑native architectures, NGINX helps you accelerate your IT infrastructure and application modernization efforts"
- "With NGINX, you can use the same tool as your load balancer, reverse proxy, content cache, and web server, minimizing the amount of tooling and configuration your organization needs to maintain."
## How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?
- "NGINX also is frequently placed between clients and a second web server, to serve as an SSL/TLS terminator or web accelerator. Acting as an intermediary, NGINX efficiently handles tasks that might slow down your web server, such as negotiating SSL/TLS or compressing and caching content to improve performance."

## Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might chooose to use it.
- I guess I would just pronounce it one letter at a time, or "engine x.". Basically an organizations would choose to use it because they have a super popular website that is becoming slow because of how much traffic is being flowed through due to how many people accessing the website. NGINX helps relieve heavy traffic and speeds up the processes for a website despite the heavy traffic.
