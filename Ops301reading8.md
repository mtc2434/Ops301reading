# Computer Network | AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) Notes
## Explain each of the three Aâ€™s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.
- The Three A's are kind of like a govenrment official with a top secret clearance. They want to access a specific building? Their Identification must be checked. This is authentication. The Level of clearance and need to know dictates what records he can access. This is authorization. The gov official has all his actions recorded, as he is dealing with sensitive information and must be supervised as to what he is doing/will do with sensitive data. His activities/records are tracked. This is Accounting.

## What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?
- Try other methods for authentication, ask for assistance. Make sure you are putting in the right information. restart the server. 
## What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.
- It connects the users and the access control server. Kind of like a gateway.

# RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) Notes
## What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?
- managing credentials is easier, Scalability, Enhanced security, Different kinds of authentication methods, and accounting.
## What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?
- Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service. It is a client-server protocol and network security protcol in which it makes it easier to perform authentication, authorization, and accounting on a large scale.

## Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
- passwords, challenge handshake, extensible authentication
