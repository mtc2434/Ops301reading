# What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters?

## In your own words, describe network segmentation.
- Network Segmentation is the process of splitting a networks into smaller portions

## Network segmentation isnâ€™t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
- I disagree. Certain activities would perform better if the traffic is isolated to tasks specific to the network. A firewall has to do too much already, and it is more of a security risk if you have everything on one network

## What is a screened subnet?
- A screened subnet is a segment of a network that is inbetween the internal and external network. An example would be the internet

## Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
- These are forms of physical security, also linked to authentication in some of these examples.
